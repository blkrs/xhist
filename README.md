# Description

I've noticed that using bash history might be improved by fetching commands
executed in current folder. This script is my first approach to do that.

# Installation

Place `xhist.sh` file in your home folder.

In `.bashrc` add line `. xhist`.

# Usage

## to fetch whole folder history

`$xhist`

## to filter commads by `keyword`

`xhist keyword`
